# dotfiles
Simple Linux configuration files

## Goal
This repository is meant to hold my preferred configuration files
for the software I use. This includes shells, git, vim etc. It also
contains a simple shell script to install them.

## Motivation
I have been continuousely nagged by friends telling me I should do this for
my sake. And know I have crashed my linux, I understand why.
